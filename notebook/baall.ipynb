    "An ontology is a repository of knowledge formally expressed in some machine-readable language. Typically, this language is some flavor of \"description logic\", which is a mathematical language used to express definitions of classes and relations between individuals belonging to those classes.\n",

    "Consider the following hypothetical scenario: a smart block of flats provides assisted living services to its elderly inhabitants. Specifically, it keeps track of an inventory of ingredients and cooks food for them; it is also aware of medical histories and dietary preferences. The smart block of flats would be interested in knowing things such as,\n",
